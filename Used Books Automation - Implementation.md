- Create dashboard for system health visualization
- Set up log aggregation and analysis

#### 3.2 Intelligent Alerting
- Configure multi-channel alerting (email, Slack, SMS)
- Set up alert severity levels and escalation policies
- Implement alert grouping to prevent alert fatigue
- Create on-call schedule if needed

#### 3.3 Proactive System Maintenance
